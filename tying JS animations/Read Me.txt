Trying to figure out how to use intersection
to trigger a CSS animation. I have the basic
idea set up with this test file, but I'm now
trying to figure out how to offset the animations.

Because I am adding a CSS class to the items
that will be animated, there's no way for me to add
an offset in the CSS file itself--so I need to  tell
javascript to loop adding the CSS class that contains
the animation every 3/1000 of a second or so in order
to make a type of cascading effect.
